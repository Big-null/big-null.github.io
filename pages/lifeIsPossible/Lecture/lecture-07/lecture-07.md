Lecture 07 - Project Week 1

# Project details Planning:
Here are some tips for your planning:

1. Determine the `Project topic` first
2. Then think about the `features` (what we need in our PWA)
3. Think about the style and theme
4. Determine what `pages` we need to have and WHO work on it
5. Open a Gituhb repository and invite all groupmates.
6. Open those blank `pages` / `folder` / `file` first and have a git push.
7. Other groupmates `git pull` the file and start working.

# Showcase
Each group will deploy the PWA in `vercel` and others can be able to access the site.

Each group will have a 4-8 minutes time to present the PWA to others.
