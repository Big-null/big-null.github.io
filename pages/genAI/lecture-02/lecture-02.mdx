## Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

The fundamental concepts of how your prompts will be translated into images.

> GAN utilizes multiplicative integration that allows flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of the successful StyleGAN network.

### What happens in GAN

Several key words that you have to know:

- `Noise`: A math generated `random` noice images.

- `Generator (CNN)` : Generate images by input `Noise`, and output the `images`
`Convolutional neural network (CNN)`

- `Discriminator (DNN)`: Try to identify `Generator` images whether it s similar to the real image.
`Deconvolutional Neural Network (DNN)`

In the early stages, the generated image will appear as noise

### GAN process

In brief, the GAN process reconstructs noise into meaningful images using deep learning methods.

e.g. 
- `Convolutions Networking (CNN and DNN)`
- `Transformer in vision (VIT)`
- `Feed forward Dense`



### Forward to 2022 / 2023
SDXL: Improving Latent Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis
A latent diffusion model for text-to-image synthesis. Which implemented text-encoder to allow models to generate text related `noise` for reconstruct prompt related images.

- `SD`: Stable Diffusion
- `SDXL`: Stable Diffusion XL

## Latent Space

<div class="columns">

<div>

> lower-dimensional space that captures the essential features of the input data.

In the `QKV` structure, the latent space of the visual aspect refers to specific features or characteristics, somewhat similar to the `PCA` method.

You can establish the relationship between text and images through various aspects such as color, location, object, action, and more.

### System Implications of Multi-Modal Generation

![w:1200](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*MIN6ugtDS5Sfzc1JWTKS_g.png)

1. Your `prompt` will be processed with a `text-encoder` to generate `noise images`.
2. The `noise` image will be reconstructed into real images using the SD models multiple times with a `Denoising U-Net`, which consists of an `encoder` and `decoder` network similar to `GAN`.
3. The `Latent Space` stores all the text and image features, helping the models generate relevant `noise` based on input prompts.
4. The `SD models` are pretrained on numerous labeled images with prompts, enabling them to understand the relationship between text and image noise features.

## Terms for Config

Understanding these fundamental terms will help you grasp the basics of `text-to-media`, even though some syntax or tools may become deprecated or unsuitable for your final assignment with selected tools.

### Generation configs 

- `CFG scale (guidance scale)`:  
Means `Temperacture`, higher value means to more precise to your prompt.
(You can imagine it to "creativity" control)

- `Sampler`:  
The `method` to generate the `noise` image. Refer to your selected models.

- `Steps (Epoch)`:  
How many steps will the generate process to the `noise` image, please refer to `page 10` epoch.

- `Seed`:  
The random fixed number for you to obtain the same result. 

- `CLIP Skip`:  
Constative Language-Image Pre-training, used to transfer your prompt into noise vector.
`CLIP Skip` provides the possibility to skip several `text-encoding` layers, to prevent `overfitting` in `SD`.
(AKA: How accurate you want the text model to be)

- `Prompt`:  
Your input prompt, to generate the desire images / video

- `Negative Prompt`:  
Your input negative prompt, to prevent the model to generate these unwanted items. (e.g. Bad hands, NSFW, two heads...)

- `Embaddings`:  
A preset of `Prompt`, means a scripted text embaddings for specific prompt text. Can be scripted to `Negative prompt` or `Positive prompt`


### Token Weighting: `Prompt Emphasis` 
- Increases attention: `( )` , `(( ))`, `(token:n.n)`
- Decreases attention: `[]`, `[[ ]]`

Which helps to scale the affect power the target prompt text.

e.g. `boy, (big head: 1.5), sunny day`
The affect of `big head` will be scale to 1.5 in this prompt.


### `lora`
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique used to add parameters and incorporate unseen fine-tuning data into existing models.

LORA Applications: 

- Allow an `SD model` to generate an unseen character (e.g., Eren Yeager).
- Add various `styles` to generated models (e.g., hand drawings, cartoon style).
- Enhance models by adding `details` or making `adjustments`.
